Sweeney has said she does not consider on-screen nudity a boundary.[37]\n\nIn 2020, Sweeney founded the production company Fifty-Fifty Films.[38] The same year, she starred in the television film Nocturne and Webtoon's live-action advertisement for the online comic Lore Olympus, appearing as Persephone.[39][40][41] In 2021, Sweeney appeared in the first season of Mike White's anthology series The White Lotus[42][43] as a sardonic college sophomore.[44] For that performance, she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie in 2022. She appeared on the Time 100 Next list for 2022.[45]\n\nIn 2023, Sweeney starred as U.S. Air Force veteran Reality Winner in Tina Satter's thriller drama Reality, which premiered in February at the 73rd Berlin Film Festival. Steph Green of IndieWire called the film \"inventively mounted and extraordinarily tense\" and Sweeney \"the real deal\".[46] Jessica Kiang of Variety wrote that she played Winner \"so convincingly that it's hard to remember her as the sardonic, pampered teen in The White Lotus, or the nice-girl-turned-nasty in Euphoria\".[47] Sweeney next had a role in the crime thriller Americana, which premiered at the South by Southwest Festival in March 2023.[48][49]\n\nSweeney starred in the video for the Rolling Stones' single \"Angry\", from their 2023 album Hackney Diamonds.[50] In response to criticism that the video objectified her, she defended it as \"empowerment through embracing my body\".[51] At age 25, Sweeney was selected as one of Forbes's 2023 30 Under 30 in the celebrity category.[52][53] She and Glen Powell starred in the romantic comedy Anyone but You, which premiered in December 2023.[54] It became a commercial sleeper hit.[55] Sweeney was an executive producer for the film and was instrumental in hiring Powell and director Will Gluck. She also contributed to the script.[56]\n\nIn 2024, Sweeney had a supporting role in the superhero film Madame Web, set in Sony's Spider-Man Universe franchise.[57][58] It was released in February and received negative reviews, bombing at the box office.[59][60] Of the film's commercial and critical failure, Sweeney said, \"I was just hired as an actress in it, so I was just along for the ride for whatever was going to happen.\"[61] In March 2024, Sweeney hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live.[62] Following her appearance, conservative Canadian newspaper National Post ran an article asking \"Are Sydney Sweeney's breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\"[63][64] and right-wing academic Richard Hanania tweeted \"Wokeness is dead\" alongside a clip of Sweeney centered on her bust.[65][66] Sweeney called the obsession with her appearance \"this weird relationship that people have with me that I have no control over\".[67]\n\nSweeney at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival red carpet premiere of Christy\n\nSweeney then produced and starred in the psychological horror film Immaculate.[68] Sweeney originally auditioned for the project in 2014. Years later, she purchased the rights to the screenplay and hired frequent collaborator Michael Mohan to direct.[69] Sweeney has said that she considered producing a way to create opportunities for herself.[70] Later in 2024, she co-starred in Eden, directed by Ron Howard.[71] Reviewing the film for TheWrap, critic Chase Hutchinson wrote that Sweeney \"runs away with the whole thing ... it's her subtle looks and a growing agency that turns Eden into something more ... every moment with her at the forefront is Eden at its best.\"[72]\n\nIn June 2025, Sweeney starred alongside Julianne Moore in Echo Valley.[73] She learned how to ride horses for the role.[74] In August, Americana was released in theaters to low box office. Several medias labeled it a flop, though Deadline argued that it would be profitable in terms of an indie film.[75] Christy, a biopic about boxer Christy Martin, had its world premiere at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival.[76] In addition to starring in the film, Sweeney also produced it.[77] Of taking the role, Sweeney said: \"I was blown away and inspired by [Martin's] strength, her perseverance, and who she is as a woman. Having a character that has so many layers and depths, that's a dream as an actor... Then, on the physical side, I grew up kickboxing and grappling. I'm a very outdoorsy, athletic person, so to play a character that [required me] to transform myself was a dream. I loved every part of it.\"[78]",

Hollywood[21] di Quentin Tarantino, dove interpreta il membro della Family Dianne \"Snake\" Lake, oltre a interpretare la parte di Cassie Howard nella serie televisiva della HBO Euphoria.[22] Lo spettacolo è stato un successo strepitoso, diventando la seconda serie HBO più vista.[23] La sua interpretazione ha ricevuto elogi, guadagnandosi una nomination per il Primetime Emmy Award come miglior attrice non protagonista in una serie drammatica nel 2022.[24]\n\nSweeney è la fondatrice della società di produzione Fifty-Fifty Films, lanciata nel 2020. Lo stesso anno, ha recitato nel film televisivo Nocturne[25] e nella pubblicità live-action di Webtoon per il fumetto online Lore Olympus, interpretando Persefone.[26][27] Nel 2021 è la protagonista del film The Voyeurs e Night Teeth, mentre in campo televisivo recita nella prima stagione di The White Lotus di Mike White.[28] Per la sua interpretazione del personaggio, è stata nominata per il Primetime Emmy Award come miglior attrice non protagonista in una serie o film limitata o antologica nel 2022. I suoi successi le sono valsi un posto nella lista Time 100 Next per il 2022.[29]\n\nNel gennaio 2023, Sweeney è diventata ambasciatrice del marchio per le aziende Armani Beauty e Laneige.[30][31] Ha recitato nel ruolo del veterano dell'aeronautica militare statunitense Reality Winner nel thriller drammatico di Tina Satter Reality[32], presentato in anteprima al 73º Festival del cinema di Berlino. Steph Green di IndieWire ha trovato il film \"montato in modo inventivo e straordinariamente teso\" e ha etichettato Sweeney come \"una vera professionista\".[33] Jessica Kiang di Variety ha scritto di aver interpretato \"Winner in modo così convincente che è difficile ricordarla come l'adolescente sarcastica e viziata in The White Lotus, o la brava ragazza diventata cattiva in Euphoria\".[34] Sweeney ha poi avuto un ruolo nel thriller poliziesco Americana, presentato in anteprima al South by Southwest Festival nel marzo 2023.[35][36]\n\nHa recitato nel video musicale del singolo dei The Rolling Stones Angry, dal loro album del 2023 Hackney Diamonds.[37] In risposta alle critiche secondo cui il video la oggettificava, Sweeney lo ha difeso definendolo \"un modo per dare potere abbracciando il mio corpo\".[38] All'età di 25 anni, Sweeney è stata selezionata come una delle 30 Under 30 del 2023 da Forbes nella categoria celebrità.[39][40] Sweeney ha recitato con Glen Powell nella commedia romantica Anyone but You, presentata in anteprima nel dicembre 2023. È diventato un successo commerciale inaspettato.[41] Sweeney è stata produttrice esecutiva del film ed è stata determinante nell'assunzione del co-protagonista Glen Powell e del regista Will Gluck, oltre a contribuire alla sceneggiatura.[42]\n\nNel 2024, Sweeney compare nel film di supereroi Marvel comics Madame Web, ambientato nel franchise Sony's Spider-Man Universe, diretto da S. J. Clarkson, in cui interpreta il personaggio di Julia Carpenter / Spider-Woman.[43][44] È uscito nel febbraio 2024, ricevendo recensioni negative e un fiasco al botteghino.[45][46] Per quanto riguarda il botteghino e il fallimento critico del film, Sweeney ha detto \"Sono stata semplicemente assunta come attrice, quindi ero solo lì per il viaggio per qualsiasi cosa sarebbe successo.\"[47] A marzo, ha ospitato un episodio di Saturday Night Live.[48] Ha poi prodotto e recitato nel film horror psicologico Immaculate - La prescelta.[49] Inizialmente ha fatto un provino per il progetto nel 2014. Anni dopo, ha acquistato i diritti della sceneggiatura e ha assunto il frequente collaboratore Michael Mohan per dirigere.[50] Sweeney ha detto che ha considerato la produzione un modo per creare opportunità per se stessa.[51] Lo stesso anno è co-protagonista in Eden diretto da Ron Howard.[52] Recensendo il film per TheWrap , il critico Chase Hutchinson ha detto: \"(Sweeney) scappa via con tutto ... è il suo aspetto sottile e una crescente agenzia che trasforma Eden in qualcosa di più ... ogni momento con lei in prima linea è Eden al suo meglio.\"[53]\n\nNel 2025, Sweeney ha recitato al fianco di Julianne Moore in Echo Valley.[54] Ha imparato ad andare a cavallo per il ruolo.[55] Recita nel film Christy, dove mette su 13kg di muscoli per diventare Christy Martin.[56]",

For a woman, it also represents her father, and later her husband. The Sun is one of the most important symbols in the birth chart, as much as the Ascendant, then the Moon (a bit less for a man), the ruler of the Ascendant and the fast-moving planets. It's element is fire; it is hot and dry, it governs Leo, is in exaltation in Aries and is in analogy with the heart. It represents the boss, authority, beside the father and the husband ; the age of the Sun goes from 20 years old to about 40, following the Venus age when one is aware of his seductive power. Temperament: Bilious Characterology: Emotive, Active, Secondary, passionate type. For more information, see the page dedicated to the Sun. Sun in Virgo You strive to organize the components of your daily life. While external disorders do not affect you, everything related to your personality and your environment must be tidy. You have a perfectionist but anxious nature, exceedingly meticulous: you enjoy discussing details, analyzing and criticizing. Your concern to keep your environment under your control requires modesty and distance. However, it is impossible to mention your sign without shedding away a wrong, although generally accepted idea: no, Virgo is not doomed to the lowest steps' eternal servitudes! She is not the society's reject who works in the last office at the dead end of the corridor. Virgo is aware of her limits and she prefers to stick to what she masters rather than to venture into hazardous places. Her capacity to keep her small universe under control constitutes a major asset, an extraordinary drive for growth. As one focuses on what one excels in, one can go a long, a very long way... With methods that you probably devised yourself, you clarify, you purify and you work by a process of elimination, up to the point where only the essential remains. You may lack ambition. Never mind! You leave panache and appearances to superficial people and you take up challenges in your unique style: with discretion, restraint and reserve. Sun in House X With the Sun in the 10th House, you pay high attention to your social image, you try to have your capacities acknowledged, and you want to arouse respect and admiration. In a word, you want to find your place in the sun. It is not that easy... Whereas successes increase your enthusiasm and your efficiency tenfold, failures may get you disheartened. Therefore, it is preferable to make your task easier, and to reinforce your self-confidence which may be weak. Your fulfilment depends on your social success, and on getting other people's recognition. Sun Dominant If the Sun is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Solarian: you loathe pettiness and Machiavellian manoeuvre, and you are fond of natural nobleness as well as of direct and honest attitudes. You endeavour to get out of muddled or dark situations as quickly as possible. Your need for transparency may lead you to make cut-and-dried judgments such as yes or no, and black or white. However, your honesty commands your entourage's consideration. At times, you come across as authoritarian. It is true that you never want to be thought of the notable absentee, and that you manage to make people pay attention to you, as well as to your plans and your assessments. To this end, the Solarian sometimes develops a great talent for placing himself under the spotlight without missing a single opportunity to arouse interest. Some other Solarians, although more discreet, still manage to be the focus of any debate, even in situations of exclusion. It is your way of being present even though you are actually not there... More than other people, you appreciate the esteem extended to you. It is useless to cheat with you, since in all areas you consider establishing enduring relationships only with those who love you, admire you, respect you, or express some degree of affection to you. Your will to straighten out your inter-personal relationships is your strength and sometimes, your Achilles' heel. You cannot achieve anything behind the scenes. Therefore, your comportment is marked with heroism, and your stands are devoid of ambiguity, in the sense that your commitments are unfailing, and your rebuffs, final. Interpretation of the 20° Virgo symbolic degree \"A food wholesaler holds a heavy bag of money in one hand and silver coins in the other.\" (Janduz version) Petty, stingy, and mercenary character. One is interested in financial profits and strives relentlessly to increase one's wealth, considering every penny spent, including those meant to meet basic daily needs such as meals and clothes. Speculations in food and raw materials are very lucrative. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

For more information, see the page dedicated to the Moon. Moon in Capricorn On the day and at the time of your birth, the Moon was in the sign of Capricorn. In your private sphere and your daily rhythms, you give precedence to moderation and reserve over the untimely excesses of your imagination. Your nature is more contemplative than excited and your deep sensitivity is controlled. It is probably the reason why you are sometimes criticized for your coldness. An ivory tower protects your fragile sensitivity. Your lunar sign belongs to a zodiacal axis (Cancer-Capricorn) that is particularly selective and self-protective: your close friends are handpicked and carefully chosen for their natural affinities with your personal realm. The external world is often disturbing. Therefore, you must create an enclosed environment where your fragile sensitivity can freely blossom. The only danger may be that you imprison your life rhythms in immutable rites and in a simplistic daily ceremonial. With more flexible intimate behaviours, your sensitivity can be fully expressed and the absolute harmony you dream of can be achieved. Moon in House II The Moon is in your 2nd House. Familiar objects have a lot of importance to you. Souvenirs, images redolent of your secret dreams, real estate, etc. They all contribute to the making up of your world and your home. You have the feeling that you own something only when you are in communication with it. Therefore, you select your capital according to your sensitivity. You are a second-hand goods dealer to the core, rather than a stock exchange speculator, and you sometimes give a fanciful value to things. Moon Dominant If the Moon is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Lunarian: the driving force behind your actions is mainly the pursuit of well-being and tranquillity. Your sensitive and romantic self lives on those periods of rest during which you let your imagination wander at will. This is your way of finding inspiration and balance. Nothing is allowed to disturb your feeling of fulfilment and security within a harmonious cell, be it a family or a clan. More than other people, the Lunarian is attached to those moments during which one forgets one's worries and lets oneself cast adrift aimlessly, with no other goal than to be lulled into an ambiance, a situation, or a perfect moment. Many people do not understand such absences and their meaning, which is to regain strength. These people readily describe you with such unflattering terms as apathy and nonchalance. Never mind! Some inspirations require surrendering as well as striking a balance derived from alternate action and passivity. Your qualities are expressed to the fullest in situations which demand familiarity and privacy. Your capacities to respect and blend into your environment is at least as valuable as some other people's aggressive dispositions. However, you are well-advised to avoid indolence and renunciation out of laziness or indifference. Interpretation of the 24° Capricorn symbolic degree \"In an amphitheatre, an arrow is shot by an invisible hand.\" (Janduz version) Ambitious, clever, and irascible character. Success requires continuous learning and training. Similarly to the pianist or the dancer who practices every day, it is necessary to constantly hone one's skills in order to maintain them at the highest possible level. It is at this condition that one can achieve success in a career requiring dexterity, or in education and literature. According to Manilius, a Roman astrologer and poet of the 1st century of the Christian era, this degree endows with great manual and intellectual nimbleness, but it also indicates that triumphs and celebrity are often followed by disfavour. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

Mercury in Virgo Mercury describes your relations, your communication skills and the way you relate to the external world. However, other astrological elements also influence these areas. The sign Mercury occupies is significant only if Mercury is part of your planetary dominantes. In your chart, Mercury is in Virgo. Communication is discreet and balanced. It is important that you properly understand the limits of your knowledge and your contacts. Assimilating information is fine. But for you, organizing them is better. You are a perfectionist regarding the choice and the quality of your relationships: limits must be borne in mind. You are credited with an analytical and often critical mind. Because every small detail may be meaningful, as you face new situations, you are anxious to keep them under control and you analyze persons and events with a magnifying glass. Your observation abilities allow you to understand the ins and outs of any given problem. The only danger is that you may clutter you life with meaningless trivial details. Mercury in House IX With Mercury in the 9th House, you feel that what is unknown to you is meant to be explored and dissected. An enriching relationship leads you far from beaten paths, as well as far from your usual marks and references. Your natural curiosity goes beyond the mere desire to know. Indeed, you need to explore, to relentlessly push back the limits of your contacts and your knowledge, to increase the number of your experiences, to understand, and to establish dialogues. Your passions include mainly erudition and synthesis. Mercury Dominant If Mercury is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Mercurian: the tradition points out the importance of communication. From idle but enriching chatters to observation gift, such a dominant endows you with a wide range of expression. Human beings have one thousand facets and one thousand masks they wear according to circumstances and the fortunes of the game of life. You take the role of an observer who is avid for novelties, discoveries, and surprises. Everything catches your attention and becomes an opportunity for new encounters, relationships, and learning. The world amazes you, amuses you sometimes, and stimulates your curiosity. Because the most important thing is to discover, and because you consider that each new situation is packed with potentialities, you try to fill the gaps in your knowledge. Although your open-mindedness may scatter your centres of interest, it also enables you to carefully avoid sticking to only one immutable and rigid view. The slightest sign enables you to perceive the other side of the coin, as well as the infinite complexity of people and of situations. On the human plane, you seek the dialogue and the information without which you know that you are not able to fully grasp the nature of your interlocutor. This keen interest in the Unknown sharpens your inter-relational skills. All these qualities are traditionally associated with Mercury. Interpretation of the 3° Virgo symbolic degree \"A young man tills the soil with a plough and a pair of oxen. As he ages, he enjoys watching the wheat ripening.\" (Janduz version) Simple and pragmatic character. Success can be achieved in agriculture or animal husbandry. Life is meaningful and happy, and old age unfolds in affluence and serenity. If the origins are modest, one is very likely to improve one's social status and purchase realties.

Temperament: Sanguine and Lymphatic Characterology: Emotive, non Active and Primary type or Emotive, non Active and Secondary type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Venus. Venus in Scorpio Venus describes your affective life. On the day of your birth, she is found in Scorpio. You demonstrate a great instinctive strength that is connected with the complex way in which you feel the world and you experience your passions. You are able to love to distraction and to hate at the same time, with an intensity that appeals to your partners but also disturbs them. It is likely that your sexuality is very strong, demanding and full of dreams and fantasies. Passion is not an empty word for you. For worse or for better, you need to love, to desire, sometimes with outrageousness. Intense passion, developed sensuality, demanding sexuality: all ingredients are brought together for love. The devil takes tepid feelings, love without fire! It is important to experience your couple's relationship intensely, even dangerously. Your charm? Distance. Love is made of surprises and suspense: with malicious pleasure, you fuel crises, tears, tensions, and everything that can keep extreme passion alive. Love is a struggle, a conquest yet to be achieved. Of course, your partner never gets bored with you. Your sentimental vehemence suits couples looking for thrills. You may hurt the person whose heart elected you. Fatality! However, it is likely that your taste for extreme passion allows to experience exceptionally intense moments of happiness. Venus in House XI Venus expresses her characteristics through the 11th House values. You make no difference between fraternal friendship and absolute love. Affective relationships are marked by a complicity which turns your couple into a full-fledged entity. Al least, in theory! Although the application of this principle does not go without creating problems, you stick to your ambition to establish exemplary relationships. The world is so much more beautiful when affectivity comes into play! Do you have friends who are artists, or sensitive to aesthetics? Venus Dominant If Venus is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Venusian: you are a sensual and emotional person particularly receptive to the natural likes and dislikes aroused by your contact with people. You are prone to frequent instinctive aversions and true passions which are exclusively driven by the feeling of love. The heart has its reasons which Reason knows nothing of... Your balance is based on the richness of your affective life. Without love, the Venusian is resourceless, lost, and deprived of any reason for living. You have an obvious and strong will to charm and to arouse the attachments without which you cannot properly function. Every area of your life is thus marked by your affectivity. The danger is that you may \"be taken in\" by charm. In such cases, you would prefer to keep your emotions under better control. Thus, hyper-sensitivity has its own inconveniences. Nevertheless, better than anyone else, you know how to play with feelings and attractions. Although you are sometimes caught in the traps of an over sensitive emotionalism, feelings remain your best assets in many circumstances. There is another aspect to the Venusian dominant. According to the Tradition, this planet rules the Arts, and you are endowed with some degree of artistic dispositions, ranging from good to excellent. Interpretation of the 0° Scorpio symbolic degree \"A wounded man lies at the feet of an armed warrior beside a chest brimming with jewels.\" (Janduz version) Foolhardy, combative, and intransigent character. One does not hesitate to get involved in conflicts, no matter how dangerous they might be. There is a strong probability of violence and accident, whether one is the perpetrator or the victim. If aggressive instincts are constructively canalised, one may be entrusted with a position of authority and achieve success through acts of bravery.

Then, you leave no stone unturned without fearing the consequences of your deeds. This configuration describes activists, mystic campaigners, and pioneers of the unknown. You do not shirk from sacrifices when you deem that the cause is just. Mars Dominant If Mars is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Marsian: in your hand-to-hand struggle for life, you demonstrate an acute and active sense of confrontation with the world, with other people, and with your own destiny. You need to take action and to fight for your projects and your desires. You perceive all situations with deep intensity, and you react to the here and now without bothering to step back in order to ensure that events are under your control. You take up challenges with excessive foolhardiness as a consequence of your impulsiveness. However, better than anyone else, you know how to mobilise your resources in case of crisis. You take action whenever it is necessary to do so, and you are present in a timely manner. With Mars, your attitudes are dictated by the realities of the moment, by your emotions, and by everything which proved to have worked in the past. When this dominant is not well integrated, it may bring about an aggressive or impulsive behaviour. Therefore, you must learn to control your hyper-sensitivity and your fits of temper.

When this willpower is well channelled, its precious energy enables to cope with all sorts of contingencies.

Temperament: Sanguine Characterology: Emotive, Active, Primary type; it is an extrovert Choleric. Actually the humid version of Mars, inclined to action like him. For more information, see the page dedicated to Jupiter. Jupiter in Aquarius The planet Jupiter symbolizes expansion, broadness and generosity. Jupiter is associated with the functions of synthesis, enthusiasm and optimism. In your natal chart, his house position is more important than his sign position because, like Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Jupiter in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. Jupiter in Aquarius stimulates your mental activities and favours the area of collective or humanitarian projects. In these fields, you can easily assert your originality and develop your interests for new topics and unusual things in general: sciences, higher technologies, but also esoterism, astrology and occultism. Your friendship life is favoured too by this configuration. Jupiter in House III Jupiter is in the 3rd House. To discover the world, to establish a relationship, or to understand a concept mean above all to find a common language with other people, and to act as a sociable person. Assimilating a knowledge, or learning the modalities of a relationship, enables one to find one's place, one's social function, and one's raison d'être. Communication is your tool for social cohesion. It offers you an opportunity for personal fulfilment based on respect, law, and dialogue. Jupiter Dominant If Jupiter is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Jupiterian: because this planet brings about a keen interest in social and professional success, the Tradition considers it to be beneficial. Indeed, you know how to adjust to events and to jump at the chance when it arises. The members of your entourage gladly entrust you with high responsibilities because they are often impressed by your learning skills and your adaptation abilities as you deal with new structures and new languages. What is the secret of your good star? It is your self-confidence which wins public support. Now, what is the secret of your charm? Definitely, enthusiasm, euphoria, and exaltation. Exaggeration also. When this dominant is well integrated, it is a factor of affluence and optimism, and a certain degree of joviality enables you to easily fit into various spheres. It constitutes your main asset to manage your life. However, you must at times curb your desire for integration, lest your sense of opportunity turns into extreme opportunism. Here also, the key to success lies in a correct estimate of everyone's chances and possibilities. Although management is one of your forte, and you can adjust your objectives to current realities better than other people, you lack the hindsight which enables you to avoid short-term vagaries and daily fluctuations. If you strive too much to adapt, you run a risk of betraying yourself. This is the other traditional side of the coin with \"The Greater Benefic\"! Interpretation of the 13° Aquarius symbolic degree \"A man stands in front of a broken bridge and a raging torrent.\" (Janduz version) Courageous, wise, and helpful character. One is used to stand up for oneself since childhood, and one has thus developed great resourcefulness and self-sufficiency. Owing to one's wisdom, one attracts many genuine friends. This degree indicates a possible accident affecting the limbs and limiting the mobility, or a reversal of fortune caused by unpredictable phenomena such as flood, earthquake, or war. In such extreme circumstances, wealthy and grateful friends prove reliable and readily offer their support. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

Saturn in Aries The planet Saturn symbolizes contraction, effort, time, limitation and concentration. Saturn eliminates anything that is not authentic, sooner or later. It is impossible to cheat him as he gives an irresistible desire to form a coherent whole with oneself, in responsible and wise ways. He is the great purifier. He represents our limitations but also our truth. In your natal chart, the house position where Saturn is posited is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Saturn in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. Saturn in Aries decreases your impulsiveness, your primary-ness and your spontaneity. But it endows you with more patience, tolerance and reflection in the long run. Saturn in House V With Saturn in your 5th House, love is not a trivial topic. Neither is childhood, nor creation. Whatever you give is pondered over, and carefully thought through. Therefore, your sentimental comportments are complex, demanding, and selective. You are prone to doubt and questioning, and above all, you seek the genuineness of passions and creations. Childhood brings back memories of a pretty rigid education which was in line with established rules. Saturn Dominant If Saturn is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Saturnian: you gladly leave to other people the decision to take life as it comes. As far as you are concerned, you prefer to take advantage of your experiences in order to discover, to grow, and to question yourself. Interpretation of the 18° Aries symbolic degree \"In a poor house, an old man in a worn out robe fearfully holds two bags of gold against his chest.\" (Janduz version) Stingy, misanthropic, and greedy character. One is only interested in increasing one's wealth, through honest or less honest means, and one displays an obsessive attachment to gold. One prefers to live in solitude, estranged from relatives and friends, for fear that they might borrow money. One would be well-advised to change one's behaviour, to indulge in a more comfortable life, and to learn the value of sharing. Otherwise, sooner or later, one will lose one's riches through a natural disaster, war or revolution, or robbery. Indeed, this degree warns against gold hoarding.

Temperament: Nervous to the extreme Characterology: Emotive, Active, Secondary type; it is a Passionate type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Uranus. Uranus in Aquarius The planet Uranus symbolizes originality, independence and cerebral energy bursting suddenly. Uranus triggers the irresistible need for freedom that we have in ourselves. Uranus tends to break the constraints that have become unbearable and gives us the courage and the will to get rid of what has become a burden; when he is well aspected, he also indicates genius. In your natal chart, Uranus' house position is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Uranus in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. The sign positions of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have a collective meaning. They do not influence your personality, unless they are involved in numerous aspects or when they emphasize a personal point of your natal chart such as your Ascendant's ruler, an angular planet, i.e. a planet near the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Nadir or the Descendant. In such cases, the activity of the slow planet is very highlighted. Uranus in Aquarius is in his own sign and, according to the Tradition, he is most potent and at his best: you are freedom-oriented and your desire to revolutionize the world in your fields of interest is irresistible. You are attracted by avant-gardist areas such as higher technologies, astrology etc... Uranus in House II With Uranus in the 2nd House, you are not afraid of reversals of fortune. You manage your assets in a very personal way. Therefore, you lay yourself open to violent disruptions and you do not hesitate to endanger your tranquillity whenever a new opportunity arises. One day, out of the blue, you risk everything you own with the determination of those who fear neither the worse, nor... the best. You deem that you are entitled to gamble away your possessions, to lose them, or to double your stake. Uranus Dominant If Uranus is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Uranian: personal values are prevailing. Inner certainties fuel an inflexible will and a desire to call attention on yourself as well as to follow your beliefs through. This planet prompts you to behave with determination, to put forward your own truth, and to start your personal revolution. More than other people, you are willing to keep some degree of autonomy in all circumstances, and you often display an individualistic nature. In order to achieve your ideal of freedom and independence, you may act like a despot as you try to convince and to impose your views, whether smoothly or forcefully. Regardless of the flexibility of your comportment, some situations demand an absolute firmness as well as uncompromising, frank and straightforward attitudes. People may criticise you for your intransigence and say that you are a hardliner. Outsider's opinions don't matter! The most important thing is that you act in all conscience and reach your primary objectives. More than anyone else, you know how to use your willpower and to focus your energy on a precise aim, relentlessly, whatever the consequences might be. In the chapter of qualities, let's mention a definite sense of responsibility, an innovative mind open to techniques and modern ideas, as well as a natural self-discipline which overcomes many an obstacle. Therefore, people are well-advised not to hound you into a corner. Interpretation of the 5° Aquarius symbolic degree \"An archer standing in a meadow aims his arrow at the sun without paying attention to the flames burning the grass near him.\" (Janduz version) Fiery, shrewd, and idealistic character endowed with great intellectual capacities and persuasion powers.

Neptune in Capricorn The planet Neptune symbolizes extreme receptivity, intense emotional sharpness, impressionability and inspiration; it is the planet of mediums, mystics and religious faith. In an astrological chart, it indicates dilution, vagueness, understanding one's environment through emotions and the absence of clear and determined limits and structures. In your natal chart, Neptune's house position is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Pluto, he is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Neptune in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. The sign positions of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have a collective meaning. They do not influence your personality, unless they are involved in numerous aspects or when they emphasize a personal point of your natal chart such as your Ascendant's ruler, an angular planet, i.e. a planet near the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Nadir or the Descendant. In such cases, the activity of the slow planet is very highlighted. Neptune in Capricorn brings a touch of humanity and emotion into your ambition made of cold and calculated vision. Or, on the contrary, it may disrupt your precise and clear vision of your professional future. Neptune in House II Neptune is in the 2nd House. It is impossible to keep good fortune under your control. The most you can do is to beseech it to smile on you. All the things you own are there by chance, or else by magic. You sometimes blindly follow your intuitions, searching for an opportunity to make a profit or an acquisition. In many instances, good luck turns out to be a mirage and a disappointment. And then some day, you find it under quite extraordinary circumstances. If your life is devoted to business, it is most likely that you seldom hesitate to tempt fate, and that you speculate. Neptune Dominant If Neptune is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Neptunian: your intuition is highly developed. You are of a contemplative nature, and you are particularly receptive to ambiances, places, and people. You gladly cultivate the art of letting-go, and you allow the natural unfolding of events to construct your world. You follow your inspirations, for better or for worse. At times, you display an extraordinary clairvoyance gift. You seem to be able to read your subconscious like a book, and you track down subtle underlying mechanisms, flaws, or open breaches. This innate intuition might explain the strokes of good luck which the Neptunian is sometimes credited with. However, you may also be the victim of illusions and misleading intuitions. You are an idealist, and you let your deepest aspirations prevail over the realities of the moment. Then, you set off in quest of some quixotic objective, living like a Don Quixote who relentlessly pursues an impossible dream. You have a great talent for psychology and the mysteries of the human soul. Since you instinctively perceive people's intents and motivations, as you swim in the complexity of human nature, you feel in your element. The subtlety of your perceptiveness is the source of both special affections and irrevocable rejections. What is the danger of such a dominant? If it is not offset by other influences in your natal chart, you may not have an iron will. Your trump card is your instinct, which may be developed to the extent that it becomes clairvoyance. Interpretation of the 27° Capricorn symbolic degree \"A man with a shining globe above his head holds a sextant in one hand and a pair of compasses in the other.\" (Janduz version) Precise, brilliant, and passionate character endowed with a vivid imagination and sharp analytical skills. Owing to one's personal qualities and exacting work, one achieves remarkable success and fame in science or in all occupations involving fire, ice, or furs. This degree heralds good luck. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports. If you wish, you can receive immediately in your mailbox your detailed astrological portrait, a nice gift for yourself or for your close friends and relatives, who will deeply appreciate it.\n\n\n\nPluto Aspects\n\nMercury square Pluto orb -0°11'\n\nPluto conjunction Ascendant orb +4°18'\n\nUranus sextile Pluto orb +2°03'\n\nSaturn sesqui-quadrate Pluto orb +0°50'\n\nSun quintile Pluto orb +1°00'\n\nNeptune sextile Pluto orb -5°43' Pluto 3°05' Sagittarius, in House I Pluto represents deep transformations, mutations and eliminations, sexuality and magnetism, power and secrets, destruction with a view to regeneration, the phoenix rising from the ashes. Its element is indefinite; burning (like lava in fusion ?), it rules Scorpio, is in exaltation in Pisces and is in analogy with the sexual organs and excretion. It represents dictators, sadistic people, violent characters, is instinctive and powerful but also mysterious with hidden strengths. Temperament: rather Bilious Characterology: Emotive or non-Emotive, Active, Primary type; it is a Passionate Choleric type. For more information, see the page dedicated to Pluto. Pluto in Sagittarius The planet Pluto symbolizes deep disruptions and upheavals, domination and sexual instincts, and the inner power we have in ourselves. Pluto destroys in order to reconstruct and he provokes painful crises that are needed in metamorphosis. Pluto is our deepest instincts' brutal force. It is the hidden and unconscious violence that can explode in us with incredible intensity before being projected in our actions; in itself, the planet is not negative: the might and the intensity of its energy are beyond the conceivable but it can be funnelled. Pluto is the only possibility we have at our disposal to overcome our inner blocks and to eliminate outgrown situations that have become inextricable. Pluto's energy is valuable because of its usefulness for the irreversible destruction of what constitutes a problem and not because of its negative side and its perversity. Pluto allows to reconstruct and to regenerate parts of our personality or whole stretches of our life, provided that we manage to funnel his wild energy and to step back. It is impossible to tame this energy, given its essence. However, it is possible to take advantage of it for a precise aim, through a temporary identification of some parts of us with this energy. In such a case, the outcome is our final evolution and even, our transformation. In your natal chart, Pluto's house position is more important than his sign position because, like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, Pluto is a slow planet. Many people born in the same period have Pluto in the same sign. This is the reason why the sign occupied here is less meaningful than when it is occupied by the so-called fast planets, i.e. the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Therefore, some caution is to be exercised as you read what follows. The sign positions of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto have a collective meaning. They do not influence your personality and they are not to be really taken into account, unless they are involved in numerous aspects or when they emphasize a personal point of your natal chart such as your Ascendant's ruler, an angular planet, i.e. a planet near the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Nadir or the Descendant. In such cases, the activity of the slow planet is very highlighted. Pluto in Sagittarius prompts you to discover and to conquer. Your appetite for power may be satisfied abroad. Pluto in House I With Pluto in the 1st House, your first look at other people is that of a foreigner. Indeed, you feel that you are different, set apart, and even excluded, the bearer of a different message or a different reality. Therefore, it is with a constant will to keep your distance that you discover the world. You do not want to be totally fooled, nor involved. No rule is absolute. People always have an agenda. It is up to you to unmask them right from the start. Pluto Dominant If Pluto is part of your natal chart's planetary dominants, in astrology, you are said to be a Plutonian: you sometimes feel like a foreigner who does not belong to the world, to its laws, and its concerns. The rules of life in society are not necessarily yours. You are interested in what is unknown and in the subtle laws of a hidden order. So, you take malicious pleasure in ridiculing the patterns you find too simplistic or too rigid. You also revel in underlining the limits of explanations you deem too common. There is something unconventional about the way you are, the way you think, and the way you act. What is your specificity made of? Is it an extraordinary partner? A life off the beaten path? Or do you only distance yourself from conventional morals? In any case, you have the feeling, sometimes quite vague, that you come from nowhere, and that you do not belong to any definite group... In short, it means that you cannot be simplified in order to conform to existing models. The gap between you and ordinary mortals is also an element of your strength. Your deep clear-sightedness, firstly, enables you to put things into perspective and to grant them only the attention they deserve. Your other remarkable asset is your capacity to intervene from behind the scenes, to secretly organise events, and to bring about the desirable outcome without seeming to impose or to dictate anything. However, you must still overcome one of the major difficulties of this dominant, which is to get people to accept your difference and to smoothly fit into your environment. Interpretation of the 3° Sagittarius symbolic degree \"A man armed with a halberd stands guard on a fortress tower. Behind an arrow loop, an archer is prepared to shoot.\" (Janduz version) Courageous, circumspect, and clever character. Ambitions are limited, and one contents oneself with a modest career as a journalist, a musician, a soldier, a bailiff, or a diplomat. The civil servant who is promoted after years of regular and diligent work is a good illustration for this degree. It may indicate a keen interest in matters dealing with altitude, such as mountainous peaks or aviation, but sometimes, it also means that one lives in the top floor of a building. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports. If you wish, you can receive immediately in your mailbox your detailed astrological portrait, a nice gift for yourself or for your close friends and relatives, who will deeply appreciate it.\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_22% Chiron is almost renowned and used everywhere. Most astrologers consider it as a kind of \"mediator\" between Saturn and outer planets. Consequently, Chiron is of Saturn's nature and at the same time is influenced by Uranus, the first slow-moving planet. Astrologically, it symbolizes wisdom, patience and the faculty to reduce others' sufferings: it is said to be the \"great healer\" of the zodiac. Like all the secondary bodies, it must be in close conjunction with planets or angles in order to fully express its action. %TEXTES_22%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_23% Ceres, the biggest of the four minor asteroids used besides Chiron, is associated with the mythological goddess of growing plants and harvest and also symbolizes physical constitution, vitality and fertility. She's also known as Demeter, according to the astrologer Zipporah Dobyns, linked to the symbolism of the mother but in a less emotive and more physical way than the Moon. Ceres is thought to be the ruler of Virgo, in exaltation in Gemini, in exile in Pisces and in fall in Sagittarius. Keywords associated with Ceres could be order, practical sense, worry, precision, modesty, method, sobriety, motherhood, fertility, the Earth: a kind of a more cerebral Moon... %TEXTES_23%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_24% Pallas is sometimes used in modern Astrology: she represents intelligence, abstract and global thinking talents. It is usually considered to be a determining element in political strategy. %TEXTES_24%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_25% Juno is the asteroid corresponding to the adaptation to the marital partner and to the defence of individual rights; it is thus used in the field of marriage. %TEXTES_25%\n\n%DYNAMIQUE_26% Vesta is rarely used and brings the ability to efficiently devote oneself to a cause. %TEXTES_26%\n\nTrue North Node 19°45' Virgo, in House X The North Node (True Node here) represents the goals that must be achieved during life, in the karmic sense according to some traditions. Its position in house indicates in what field an effort is necessary in order to evolve. The North Node is often called the Dragon's head, it is usually considered beneficial, a bit like Jupiter with the planets. The Lunar nodes are fictional points and not actual heavenly bodies: they are the intersections of the Moon with the Ecliptic (the path made by the Sun in its orbit as seen from the Earth). The axis of the Lunar nodes moves 19 degrees each year, namely a bit more than three minutes each day. The South Node is diametrically opposed to the North Node, therefore it faces it (it's not drawn here, it's the same symbol but upside down). It symbolizes what has already been achieved or acquired, in a karmic sense: it's the past from which it's advised to move on in order to progress. The South Node is rather negative, of a Saturnian nature: the experience through suffering. Interpretation of the 19° Virgo symbolic degree \"Two men cross swords without noticing the masked man who watches them across a hedge. Further down, a sparrow hawk chases a rat.\" (Janduz version) Inventive and honest character always ready to defend one's rights and the laws in general. Although not particularly quarrelsome, one never hesitates to fight back whenever one is attacked. Ingenious reforms and inventions aiming at putting an end to entrenched routine bring about success, fame, and financial gains, but also... jealousy. All go-between occupations are very favoured, including those of arbiter or mediator. Unless Jupiter and Mercury are posited in Virgo in the natal chart, and Jupiter rules the Descendant, it is advisable to avoid travelling to foreign countries because one may undergo serious accidents, treachery, political or religious conflicts, and be injured by secret enemies. Happiness and wealth are most likely to be short-lived and followed by sorrow and regrets. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\n\nTrue Lilith 0°04' Я Libra, in House X Lilith or the Dark Moon (True Lilith here) represents the uncrossable threshold, taboos, the individual's provocative and fascinating side, including on a sexual level. She symbolizes violence and \"untameability\", the radical and deep-seated refusal to submit. The keywords for Lilith can be sterility, sadism, perversity, castration, sadomasochism, eroticism, orgasm, forbidden fantasies, marginality, cruelty; redemption, illumination, rebelliousness... Lilith's opposite point is called Priapus; it is the Lunar perigee, the position where the Moon is closest to the Earth. It symbolizes man's primitive nature, the horror hidden in our deepest self; masochism, extreme sensuality, impulsiveness, irrationality and excess. Physically speaking, the Dark Moon is the focal point unoccupied by the Earth: it is not a concrete body but a mathematical point. Interpretation of the 0° Libra symbolic degree \"A man with a pistol in each hand walks in a barren land, unaware that he is followed by a man holding a sword.\" (Janduz version) Independent, assertive, and affectionate character. There is an overwhelming tendency to be over-protective with family members. Self-righteousness may lead to dangerous situations of violence with danger of severe physical and psychological injuries. This degree indicates a strong taste for the practice of weapons, and the possibility to excel in all martial arts. It also endows with the gift for healing animals, especially horses, and often describes an excellent veterinary specialist. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\n\nFortune 3°40' Aries, in House IV The Part of Fortune is an ancient concept, used by Ptolemy and other astrologers before him. Firstly, it has nothing to do with fortune! In modern astrology, it is actually used to enhance a planet or angle when in close conjunction with it: it thus amplifies the meaning associated to the point affected by its presence. It is calculated in the following way: Part of Fortune = AS + Moon - Sun (it is the Moons position when the Sun rises) The classical Part of Fortune, of which the calculus method is unchanged whether in a diurnal or nocturnal chart, is usually distinguished from the diurnal/nocturnal Part of Fortune which is calculated by the formula AS + Sun - Moon for a nocturnal chart, and AS + Moon - Sun in a diurnal chart. We currently use the latter formula for our astrological programmes. For more information, see the page dedicated to the Arabian parts. Interpretation of the 3° Aries symbolic degree \"A man takes a walk in a forest where many plants of various species grow. Another man with shaggy hair hides behind the shrubs.\" (Janduz version) Pragmatic, modest, and unsophisticated character. In spite of a great natural wisdom, one has no inclination for studies. One is driven by the sense of honour and by genuine generosity. The man hidden in the shrubs is not necessarily ill-intentioned. He may just be an original and independent person who prefers to remain out of the mainstream. In this lifetime, one can expect at least one major encounter which brings about crucial events, the positive or negative outcomes of which depend on the natal chart. All occupations related to security such as the police, the military, or the law are highly favoured. If in the natal chart, Mars is on this degree and forms hard aspects with the Sun and the Moon, he may portend a violent death. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\n\n\n\nAscendant Aspects\n\nPluto conjunction Ascendant orb +4°18'\n\nMercury square Ascendant orb -4°29'\n\nNeptune sextile Ascendant orb -1°24'\n\nMoon sextile Ascendant orb -3°49'\n\nMars conjunction Ascendant orb +9°48' Ascendant 28°47' Scorpio The First House or Ascendant represents one's behaviour in the eyes of others, and also one's health. It corresponds to the way the individual acts in the world. It is the image of the personality seen by others and the person's visible behaviour expressed outwardly. The 1st House is in analogy with Aries and thus Mars too, and then the Sun. It is an angular house, the most important one with the Midheaven, maybe even more so due to its link with the body and health. Ascendant in Scorpio Your psychological nature is bilious with aggressive impulses that spur the transformation of your being and of any situation you are involved in. You are constantly struggling to assert yourself. You cannot refrain from testing others with cutting remarks, not because you want to hurt them, but because you want to know them better through their reaction; life and the feeling of aliveness are experienced through rebellion and tension. Your aggressive attitude may equate with sly inquisition as often, you remain silent, introverted and secretive, mulling over turbulent thoughts in the depths of your mind, leaving others puzzled by your quite strange behaviour.\n\n\n\nWith this Ascendant, you come across as secretive, powerful, dominating, enduring, intuitive, assertive, charismatic, magnetic, wilful, daring, clear-sighted, passionate, creative, independent, vigorous, generous, loyal, hard-working, persevering, indomitable, possessive, shrewd, stubborn, ambitious, instinctive, tenacious, sexual, sexy, proud, intense and competitive. But you may also be aggressive, destructive, stubborn, anxious, tyrannical, perverse, sadistic, violent, self-centered, complex, critical, cruel, nasty, jealous, calculating, vulnerable and dissembling. Interpretation of the 28° Scorpio symbolic degree \"A woman in a ceremonial dress brandishes a sceptre around which a dragon-headed snake is coiled.\" (Janduz version) Ambitious, intelligent, and clever character exuding strong magnetism and sex-appeal. Personal charm and shrewdness are the keys to success. One does not hesitate to resort to indiscretion and often reveals what is supposed to remain a secret. However, if the natal chart indicates great moral integrity, success can be achieved in diplomacy and in all activities requiring mediation and negotiation skills.

The Midheaven represents our achievements and goals in the social sphere, our social position in society, and becomes more and more important as we get older. It is in analogy with Capricorn and Saturn. The Tenth House is the most important angular house along with the Ascendant. Midheaven in Virgo You are well-organised, methodical, hard-working, concentrated, and discreet, and you do not like to take risks. You tend to underestimate your own worth, and therefore, you occupy positions which are too modest for you. But it is your personal choice, and this is how you can have the feeling that you keep full control of the situation. Furthermore, your will to constantly improve yourself enables you to make up for lost time. In the second part of your life, it is most likely that you eventually spread your wings and soar up to the place which your qualities deserve.\n\n\n\nThe following professions are most likely to suit you very well: architect, industrial designer, watchmaker, computer specialist, scientific expert, mathematician, librarian, banker, chartered accountant, financial officer, stockbroker, shopkeeper, secretary, executive assistant, household aide, cleaner, social worker, civil servant, breeder, medical practitioner, pharmacist, veterinarian, physiotherapist, medical assistant, as well as Minister for Health or for Finances.

The 1st House is in analogy with Aries and thus Mars too and then the Sun. It is an angular house, the most important one with the Midheaven, maybe even more so due to its link with the body and health; the Ascendant is as important as the Sun in a natal chart. Interpretation of the 28° Scorpio symbolic degree \"A woman in a ceremonial dress brandishes a sceptre around which a dragon-headed snake is coiled.\" (Janduz version) Ambitious, intelligent, and clever character exuding strong magnetism and sex-appeal. Personal charm and shrewdness are the keys to success. One does not hesitate to resort to indiscretion and often reveals what is supposed to remain a secret.

It is in analogy with Taurus and Venus. It is a succedent house, quite important.\n\nHouse III 10°43' Aquarius The Third House is the sphere of social and intellectual apprenticeship, studies, relationships with close people and surroundings, short trips, light-hearted and quick contacts, correspondences. It is in analogy with Gemini and Mercury. It's a cadent house, less important than the angular and succedent ones.\n\nHouse IV 19°03' Pisces The Fourth House also called Immum Coeli is the sphere of inner emotions, family, the father, home and roots, but also the home one creates. It's Home Sweet Home, security and cocoon. It is in analogy with Cancer and the Moon. It's an angular and important house. Interpretation of the 19° Pisces symbolic degree \"The moon sheds its glimmering light on lopsided windmills scattered over a hill.\" (Janduz version) Indecisive, fickle, and confused character. One tends to pursue too many goals at the same time, and although not a single target is reached, one keeps on launching new undertakings. It is indispensable to focus on one sole objective and strive to fulfil it without being distracted by new fields of interest. The members of the entourage should be selected among quiet and pragmatic persons. If the natal chart indicates that the nervous system is weak, there may be a dormant mental disorder.

This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\n\nHouse V 18°41' Aries The Fifth House is the sphere of pleasures and love affairs (but not commitment or marriage), creations and entertainments, children, arts and game. It is in analogy with Leo and the Sun. It's a succedent and quite important house.\n\nHouse VI 10°53' Taurus The Sixth House is the sphere of apprenticeship and effort in the work environment, daily life, health on a daily basis and not operations or long-term diseases, relationships with co-workers or subordinates, desire for improvement, analysis and detail. It is in analogy with Virgo and Mercury. It is a cadent house, less important than the angular and succedent ones.\n\nHouse VII 28°47' Taurus The Seventh House also called the Descendant (in front of the Ascendant) is the sphere of partnership, marriage, contracts, relationships with others, the outer world. It is in analogy with Libra and Venus, and Saturn to a lesser extent. It is an angular and important house. Interpretation of the 28° Taurus symbolic degree \"A mighty man holding a whip pushes two enchained slaves before him. He is followed by a wild woman who pulls a billy goat by its horns.\" (Janduz version) Tyrannical, selfish, and fanatic character. There is a strong propensity for debauchery and sexual perversions. One imposes one's narrow-minded ideas to members of the family, friends, and employees, which arouses much hatred. Sooner or later, slaves are freed, and the despot is overthrown. If in the natal chart, the Moon is waxing and in conjunction with this degree, the constellation of the Pleiades promises high social status, fame, and honours, but it also warns against accidents affecting the face, impaired sight, or violent death. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\n\nHouse VIII 0°55' Cancer The Eighth House is the sphere of emotional security, the depths of the self, secrets and paranormal, transcendence, sexuality, mysteries, upheavals, surgical operations, others' money (investments, inheritances), crises, transformation after evolution, death.

It is in analogy with Aquarius and Uranus, and Saturn to a lesser extent. It's a succedent and quite important house.\n\nHouse XII 10°53' Scorpio The Twelfth House is the sphere of hidden things, enemies, closed or remote places (hospital, prison, convent etc.), ordeals, secrecy, solitude, long-term illnesses but also sincere devotion and genuine compassion. It is in analogy with Pisces and Neptune.\n\nVertex 11°36' Cancer, in House VIII The Vertex, sometimes called counter-Ascendant, is a fictitious point which is at the intersection of two great circles, the Ecliptic and the great vertical circle (Prime Vertical) in the West of the birthplace, linking the East, the Zenith, the West, and the Nadir. It is always located in the West of the chart around the Descendant. It is the chart's fifth angle, so to speak, less important than the other angles. Its interpretation is controversial, because certain astrologers pay no attention to it. The Vertex is sometimes considered to be the second Descendant because, like the latter, it is related to communication and exchanges. It has to do with associations and fated encounters, those that are not chosen, and reveals the type of sensitivity and reactivity we have in our dealings with other people: a refined and tolerant way in Libra, straightforward and spontaneous in Aries, etc. Interpretation of the 11° Cancer symbolic degree \"A caduceus stands between two waxing moons, a small crescent, and a nearly full moon.\" (Janduz version) Intelligent, serious, and subtle character. One is prone to extreme mood swings which shift quickly from optimism to despair and vice-versa. The waxing moon stands for remarkably good memory and indicates precocious successes in studies. Science, literature, philosophy, the arts, trips and discoveries are very favoured. It is most likely that one keeps on enhancing one's intellectual skills throughout life, and one remains interested in modern improvements even as one ages. Despite a few ordeals, life is successful. If in the natal chart, Mercury is in the 1st House and in conjunction with this degree, it heralds some unexpected reward for one's knowledge. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology. Their interpretation must be regarded with the utmost caution, especially given the fact that different authors give different meanings to symbolic degrees. This is the reason why they are not included in our Astrotheme reports.\n\nEast Point 20°45' Sagittarius, in House I The East Point is a fictitious point at the intersection of two great circles, the Ecliptic and the great vertical circle (Prime Vertical) in the East of the birthplace, linking the East, the Zenith, the West, and the Nadir. It is always located in the East of the chart, around the Ascendant. The East Point is sometimes considered to be a second Ascendant, less important, but also related to how one is seen by other people, and to how one expresses one's personality. Interpretation of the 20° Sagittarius symbolic degree \"In front of two intertwined triangles surmounted by a third one, a magus wearing his sacerdotal headdress utters an incantation.\" (Janduz version) Withdrawn, contemplative, and spiritual character endowed with powerful psychic powers. One revels in solitude and avoids socialising. Success and fame can be achieved in human sciences or in research. However, one is unlikely to become very rich. If the natal chart indicates dishonesty, this degree may describe a charlatan. N.B.: symbolic degrees belong to a branch of fatalistic astrology.

            "title": "Sydney Sweeney Birth Chart – Virgo Zodiac Sign Horoscope & Birthday",
            "text": "Sydney Sweeney’s birth chart, interpreted by The AstroTwins\n\nThe following analysis by celebrity astrologers Tali & Ophi Edut, aka The AstroTwins, highlights the most interesting astrological features of Sydney Sweeney’s birth chart for all level astrology readers to understand.\n\nWhen is Sydney Sweeney’s birthday?\n\nSydney Sweeney was born on September 12, 1997.\n\nSydney Sweeney is a Virgo Sun striving for success\n\n•The Sun represents the essence of your personality, your main character energy•\n\nEuphoria actress and American Eagle model Sydney Sweeney was born at 12:42 PM on September 12, 1997, in Spokane, Washington. Her astrological sign is Virgo.\n\nSydney’s Virgo Sun shines in the tenth house, which governs career, visibility and legacy. This placement reveals someone who needs to be seen and who strives to be competent, capable and at the top of their game. When she was a teen, she convinced her parents to move to Los Angeles after pitching them a five-year business plan for her acting career. That’s tenth house hustle!\n\nVirgo is an earth sign, so there’s a natural sensuality Sydney possesses. This solar placement also can indicate a “late bloomer” type who gains increasing knowledge, power and success over time, while seeking respect. At the time of this writing, she’s in her Saturn return (more on that in a bit).\n\nSydney Sweeney’s Capricorn moon seeks stability\n\n•Your moon sign governs the “inner you” and influences your emotions•\n\nWhile Sydney Sweeney’s Virgo Sun craves legacy, her Capricorn moon, nestled in the materially focused second house, says: “protect the assets.” This placement suggests Sydney’s emotional world is steeped in practicality. This moon sign is often found in the birth charts of people who are self-made, who are more at ease managing finances than feelings. Emotional expression might be subdued, but loyalty often runs deep—and trust has to be earned. Capricorn moons are often more comfortable being admired than truly seen for who they are.\n\nA connection to conservative values is unmistakable here. Not just politically—though that’s clearly in play since her American Eagle jeans ad erupted a cultural flashpoint—but emotionally. Capricorn moons often emphasize responsibility over feelings. They don’t cry in public—they keep an ice cold poker face. But underneath it, there’s typically a yearning to be cared for without having to prove their worth.\n\nWhen tied to the second house, this emotional stoicism also creates complex dynamics around sensuality. Sweeney has sold soap for the men’s bodywash brand Dr. Squatch containing her actual bathwater. Her SNL hosting stint sparked debate. Whatever her motives, she understands her currency and .\n\nSydney has also said that as a woman she has more to prove, telling Variety: “As a male, it’s much easier to do one movie that does really well, and then you can get offered any film that you want. And me, I’m still getting ‘Can she act?’ accusations…I’ll keep trying to prove myself, and hope that one day I can get cast with an amazing director and have a film that people recognize.”\n\nAnd the rumored conservative political leanings? They track. Capricorn moons often lean traditional, not out of blind allegiance, but because structure equals safety. Values, like everything else, are investments to be protected.\n\nSydney Sweeney’s Rising sign is intense Scorpio\n\n•Your rising sign, or ascendant, is the first impression you make. Like a filter, it “tints” your Sun sign•\n\nSydney Sweeney is a Scorpio rising. People with this placement can be hypnotic, guarded and intense. People also project onto Scorpio risings because they can’t quite figure them out—and that’s by design.\n\nThis rising sign immediately complicates her Virgo Sun and Capricorn moon. Where those placements crave control and perfection, Scorpio rising adds a layer of dark charisma that’s about power, influence and obsession. Case in point: she often complains about being objectified, but also leans into it for her benefit.\n\nIn a life imitating art example: Think of how she played Cassie in Euphoria—a character who’s so sexualized she almost disappears into male fantasy, and yet we ache for her because she’s broken beneath the beauty. That’s Scorpio rising sign at work. And like many Scorpio risings, Sydney provokes strong reactions. Admiration, lust, judgment, projection—it all sticks. Whether it’s fans thirsting over her Anyone But You beach scenes or backlash to her “great jeans” commercial, the public can’t stop reacting to her.\n\nPluto in Sagittarius: The shadow adventurer\n\n•Pluto holds the key to our personal chamber of secrets, everything from money, sex, power•\n\nPluto—the planet of transformation, power and taboo—is sitting in Sydney Sweeney’s first house, tightly conjunct her Sagittarius rising. In Sagittarius also, it adds a wild-card element. This placement is rare and can be potent: it gives someone an aura of danger, charisma and rebellion… but also, the ability to reinvent themselves, dramatically and often.\n\nPerhaps the “mirror” she holds up for herself (and for us to peer into) is revealing uncomfortable truths about desire, image and femininity. Her earlier referenced Dr. Squatch soap campaign is signature for this placement and energy: becoming a commodity, but taking control of the transaction.\n\nPluto in Sagittarius adds another twist: pushing boundaries. She’s exploring taboos, philosophies, identity. Her roles are often meta-commentaries: the cynical daughter (The White Lotus), the “promiscuous” teen (Euphoria), the whistleblower (Reality). She’s not afraid to be the villain, and may even thrive on its exploration. The eugenics controversy around her American Eagle campaign, where people debated whether she was promoting toxic ideals or satirizing them—seems textbook Pluto in the first. Her image became a battlefield for cultural projection. And Pluto loves a good confrontation!\n\nSydney Sweeney’s Love Astrology: Mystery and intrigue\n\n•Venus (and Mars) are the love planets in astrology. In your birth chart, Venus represents seduction and romance.\n\nSydney Sweeney’s love planets are both in the twelfth house!\n\nVenus in Scorpio is magnetic by nature — intense, loyal, emotionally deep. And in the 12th house: secretive, subconscious and sometimes self-sacrificing. This is a placement of someone who guards their heart. Trust is earned in drops. Betrayal cuts bone-deep.\n\nIn public, Venus in Scorpio can appear controlled, but privately, she probably feels everything. Sydney’s ability to inhabit emotionally complex female roles seems to draw from this placement, familiar with the psychology of secrecy and obsession.\n\nMars in Scorpio is one of the most relentless placements for drive. In the twelfth house, this ambition often operates quietly until it’s ready to strike. Sydney’s Mars here makes her resilient and hardworking, but without the constant need to broadcast the grind. She puts in the hours behind the scenes: training in MMA as a teen, mastering multiple sports, building a production company—then emerges fully formed, like the success was inevitable.\n\nThere’s also a deeply compassionate, even self-sacrificing thread to twelfth house Mars. It can pour enormous energy into helping others or into artistic work that explores the human condition. In her case, choosing roles like whistleblower Reality Winner or women trapped in oppressive systems (Handmaid’s Tale) taps directly into this reservoir of empathy.\n\nSydney Sweeney’s romances echo Scorpio love planets\n\nSydney’s romantic history reads textbook for her twelfth house love planets in Scorpio. She was engaged to Chicago-born businessman Jonathan Davino, a relationship that lasted seven years. Their connection was largely veiled from the public eye, she rarely spoke about him in interviews or shared red-carpet appearances. Sydney called off the engagement in 2025, telling friends she “didn’t feel right” about the wedding.\n\nAlong the way, Sydney’s love life became tabloid fodder. During the Anyone But You press tour, her playful chemistry with co-star Glen Powell sparked rumors—ones she later admitted they leaned into as a marketing tool. The speculation followed them from interviews to her SNL hosting monologue, where she cheekily brought Powell on camera in place of her then-fiancé.\n\nSydney’s been spotted in friendly company with musician Machine Gun Kelly, adding another chapter of speculation. Her mysterious Scorpio love planet placements probably ensure we’ll never get the full story unless she chooses to reveal it—and even then, will it be true?\n\nSydney Sweeney’s Saturn Return and That Ad\n\n• Every 27 to 29 years, Saturn returns to the sign it was in when you were born, a cycle called your Saturn return. This cosmic rite of passage helps you advance to your next stage of adulthood.•\n\nSydney Sweeney’s Saturn is in Aries, in the fifth house of celebrity! She also happens to be (at this writing) going through her Saturn Return.\n\nThe fifth house rules creativity, performance, romance, and the court of public opinion. Saturn here says: none of this will come easily. Recognition may arrive young, but mastery—and the ability to truly own her stage—comes only after trials. There’s often a public stumble or highly visible “lesson” during the Saturn return (ages 27–30) that forces recalibration.\n\nA Saturn Return case study: The American Eagle ad\n\nThe American Eagle campaign—with its “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans” tagline—is a textbook Saturn moment. The ad sparked backlash over perceived eugenics undertones, igniting a cultural debate about beauty, race and representation. It’s also landed her in a hot seat, and having to promote new projects in the shadow of controversy.\n\nFrom an astrological lens, Saturn here delivered its message loud and clear:\n\nthe platform you’ve built amplifies not just your art, but every word and image you attach your name to.\n\nIn the fifth house, creative risks are backed by intentional messaging, or the audience will define it for you.\n\nAries energy can be magnetic and daring, but Saturn demands strategic self-awareness before leaping!\n\nJupiter and Uranus in Aquarius: Radical, innovative, disruptive\n\n•Jupiter in your birth chart reveals where you’re adventurous and willing to take risks • Uranus shows where we’re prone to eccentricity or groundbreaking thought•\n\nBoth Jupiter (growth, beliefs) and Uranus (innovation, disruption) in Aquarius speak to an underlying desire for independence of thought. Aquarius is the sign of social change, rebellion and future-thinking ideals. When you pair Sydney Sweeney’s Jupiter (philosophical appetite) with Uranus (electric need for freedom), you get someone with the potential to leap into radically new worldviews.\n\nBut in the third house—the realm of communication—that potential is filtered through the people around her. This is a placement that soaks up perspectives from siblings, friends, colleagues and the broader cultural conversation. It’s brilliant for adaptability, but it can also mean she’s highly susceptible to the “echo chamber” effect.\n\nThis makes sense for someone who grew up in a close-knit, activity-filled family environment, then stepped straight into the insular, high-opinion bubble of Hollywood. Her ideas and politics aren’t formed in isolation, they’re being shaped in real time by the environments she moves through.\n\nRead more celebrity birth charts from The AstroTwins",

            "text": "Breakthrough (2019–present)\n\nIn June 2019, Sweeney began portraying Cassie Howard, a teenager with a promiscuous reputation, in the HBO drama series Euphoria.[33] The show was a breakout hit, becoming the second most watched HBO series.[34] Her performance was praised, earning a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2022.[35] Variety wrote that her performance \"proves that Sweeney's one hell of a shapeshifter between her deft turns in this, The Handmaid's Tale, Everything Sucks and Sharp Objects.\"[36] Her many nude scenes in the series received significant attention, generating discussions about nudity in film and the male gaze. Sweeney has said she does not consider on-screen nudity a boundary.[37]\n\nIn 2020, Sweeney founded the production company Fifty-Fifty Films.[38] The same year, she starred in the television film Nocturne and Webtoon's live-action advertisement for the online comic Lore Olympus, appearing as Persephone.[39][40][41] In 2021, Sweeney appeared in the first season of Mike White's anthology series The White Lotus[42][43] as a sardonic college sophomore.[44] For that performance, she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie in 2022. She appeared on the Time 100 Next list for 2022.[45]\n\nIn 2023, Sweeney starred as U.S. Air Force veteran Reality Winner in Tina Satter's thriller drama Reality, which premiered in February at the 73rd Berlin Film Festival. Steph Green of IndieWire called the film \"inventively mounted and extraordinarily tense\" and Sweeney \"the real deal\".[46] Jessica Kiang of Variety wrote that she played Winner \"so convincingly that it's hard to remember her as the sardonic, pampered teen in The White Lotus, or the nice-girl-turned-nasty in Euphoria\".[47] Sweeney next had a role in the crime thriller Americana, which premiered at the South by Southwest Festival in March 2023.[48][49]\n\nSweeney starred in the video for the Rolling Stones' single \"Angry\", from their 2023 album Hackney Diamonds.[50] In response to criticism that the video objectified her, she defended it as \"empowerment through embracing my body\".[51] At age 25, Sweeney was selected as one of Forbes's 2023 30 Under 30 in the celebrity category.[52][53] She and Glen Powell starred in the romantic comedy Anyone but You, which premiered in December 2023.[54] It became a commercial sleeper hit.[55] Sweeney was an executive producer for the film and was instrumental in hiring Powell and director Will Gluck. She also contributed to the script.[56]\n\nIn 2024, Sweeney had a supporting role in the superhero film Madame Web, set in Sony's Spider-Man Universe franchise.[57][58] It was released in February and received negative reviews, bombing at the box office.[59][60] Of the film's commercial and critical failure, Sweeney said, \"I was just hired as an actress in it, so I was just along for the ride for whatever was going to happen.\"[61] In March 2024, Sweeney hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live.[62] Following her appearance, conservative Canadian newspaper National Post ran an article asking \"Are Sydney Sweeney's breasts double-D harbingers of the death of woke?\"[63][64] and right-wing academic Richard Hanania tweeted \"Wokeness is dead\" alongside a clip of Sweeney centered on her bust.[65][66] Sweeney called the obsession with her appearance \"this weird relationship that people have with me that I have no control over\".[67]\n\nSweeney at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival red carpet premiere of Christy\n\nSweeney then produced and starred in the psychological horror film Immaculate.[68] Sweeney originally auditioned for the project in 2014. Years later, she purchased the rights to the screenplay and hired frequent collaborator Michael Mohan to direct.[69] Sweeney has said that she considered producing a way to create opportunities for herself.[70] Later in 2024, she co-starred in Eden, directed by Ron Howard.[71] Reviewing the film for TheWrap, critic Chase Hutchinson wrote that Sweeney \"runs away with the whole thing ... it's her subtle looks and a growing agency that turns Eden into something more ... every moment with her at the forefront is Eden at its best.\"[72]\n\nIn June 2025, Sweeney starred alongside Julianne Moore in Echo Valley.[73] She learned how to ride horses for the role.[74] In August, Americana was released in theaters to low box office. Several medias labeled it a flop, though Deadline argued that it would be profitable in terms of an indie film.[75] Christy, a biopic about boxer Christy Martin, had its world premiere at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival.[76] In addition to starring in the film, Sweeney also produced it.[77] Of taking the role, Sweeney said: \"I was blown away and inspired by [Martin's] strength, her perseverance, and who she is as a woman. Having a character that has so many layers and depths, that's a dream as an actor... Then, on the physical side, I grew up kickboxing and grappling. I'm a very outdoorsy, athletic person, so to play a character that [required me] to transform myself was a dream. I loved every part of it.\"[78]",

She also briefly attended the University of California, Los Angeles.[19]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nEarly work (2009–2019) [ edit ]\n\nSweeney in 2019\n\nBeginning her career as a child actress, Sweeney debuted on television in 2009 with a bit part in an episode of the series Heroes.[20] Her first film role was in the 2010 horror comedy ZMD: Zombies of Mass Destruction.[21] She played supporting roles in television shows such as 90210, Criminal Minds, Grey's Anatomy and Pretty Little Liars.[22][23] In 2018, she starred as Emaline Addario in the Netflix series Everything Sucks!, which revolved around two groups of high school students in Oregon in 1996.

Mainstream media widely reported on the controversy, and the Trump administration commented on it.[91][93][94][95] The Hollywood Reporter was unsure whether this \"media firestorm\" had negatively impacted the box office returns of Americana.[96] American Eagle Outfitters later praised the campaign as a great success and said they were planning other collaborations with Sweeney.[97]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nSweeney started dating businessman Jonathan Davino in 2018, and they became engaged in 2022.[98][99][100] They produced films together (including Anyone but You and Immaculate), and Sweeney considered Davino her \"producing partner\".[100] The couple separated in 2025.[101][102]\n\nSweeney is an automobile enthusiast. She has restored a 1969 Ford Bronco and a 1965 Ford Mustang, and also owns a 1956 Ford F100 with original patina, gifted by her grandfather.[103][104] As part of her partnership with Ford, Sweeney designed a custom 2024 Mustang.[105]\n\nIn 2021, Sweeney purchased 3,200-square-foot (300 m2) Tudor-style home in Los Angeles, for US$3 million.[106] In 2023, she bought a US$9.9 million \"fixer-upper mansion\" in Los Angeles's Bel Air neighborhood, and in 2024 she bought a US$13.5 million home in the Florida Keys.[106]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nKey † Denotes film or TV productions that have not yet been released\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nPodcasts [ edit ]\n\nYear Title Role Notes Ref. 2021 Strawberry Spring Anne Bray 8 episodes [ 111 ]\n\nWeb [ edit ]\n\nYear Title Role Notes Ref. 2017 In the Vault Haley Caren 7 episodes 2020 Day by Day Winnie Chapman (voice) Episode: \"Winnie, Betty and... \" 2021 Downfalls High Scarlett 2024 Hot Ones Herself Episode: \"Sydney Sweeney Endures a Nightmare While Eating Spicy Wings\"\n\nMusic video appearances [ edit ]\n\nAwards and nominations [ edit ]",

            "text": "Neon has acquired the U.S. rights to the horror film “Immaculate,” starring and produced by Sydney Sweeney. “The Voyeurs” and “Everything Sucks!” filmmaker Michael Mohan directed the original feature from a screenplay by Andrew Lobel.\n\nSweeney stars as Cecilia, a woman of devout faith who is offered a fulfilling new role at an illustrious Italian convent. Her warm welcome to the picture-perfect Italian countryside is soon interrupted as it becomes clearer to Cecilia that her new home harbors some dark and horrifying secrets.\n\nPrincipal photography on “Immaculate” wrapped earlier this year and Neon is planning a theatrical release. The cast also includes Simona Tabasco (“The White Lotus”), Alvaro Morte (“Money Heist”), Benedetta Porcaroli (“Baby”) and Dora Romano (“The Hand of God”).\n\nSweeney produced the film with Jonathan Davino for Fifty-Fifty Films, alongside Middle Child Pictures’ David Bernad, who developed the project with Sweeney following their collaboration on the Emmy-winning “The White Lotus.” Teddy Schwarzman and Michael Heimler produced for Black Bear, which fully financed and represented the international sales rights. Executive producers are Black Bear’s John Friedberg and Christopher Casanova, alongside Will Greenfield.\n\nThe deal was negotiated by Neon’s vice president of Acquisitions & Production Jason Wald with CAA Media Finance and Paradigm on behalf of the filmmakers.\n\nSweeney stars in the rom-rom “Anyone But You,” releasing this Christmas, and also appears in Sony’s Marvel adaptation “Madame Web,” which hits theaters in February.\n\nNeon most recently released Michael Mann’s “Ferrari” and is due to release Ava DuVernay’s “Origin.” In 2024, the studio will release the horror sequel “They Follow,” Sean Baker’s new romantic dramedy “Anora” and Pamela Adlon’s directorial debut “Babes” starring Illana Glazer and Michelle Buteau.",
